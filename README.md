# IncaRNAto lab's tools

__cm-builder:__ automaGically builds structural alignments of RNAs and Infernal's CMs starting from a single sequence+structure and iteratively refining the model by searching against a database of related sequences

__consensusFold:__ predicts a consensus secondary structure by aggregating multiple reactivity profiles using [ViennaRNA](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/)'s RNAalifold

__filterMM:__ post-processing of MM files prior to analysis with DRACO (filtering, extraction of target regions, etc.)

__stockholmPolish:__ cleanup of Stockholm alignments generated by `cm-builder`

__stockholm2html:__ structure-aware coloring of Stockholm alignments

__transcriptome2genome:__ transcriptome-level to genome-level conversion of BED annotations
